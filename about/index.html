<p class="lead">Hello Everyone!

Welcome to the Carleton Science Student Society! Newly formed in January of 2011, the CSSS will serve as YOUR social and academic hub for everything science at Carleton University. 

Every Carleton student enrolled in a B.Sc, B.Math or B.Comp Sci is automatically a member of the society, and is given the opportunity to participate in meetings, discussions, and run for office when that time of year approaches.

We are currently in the midst of finalizing our yearly timetable plan and we are excited to introduce our event calendar soon!
