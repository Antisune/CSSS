  <h4>Executives:</h4>

<h5>President</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Garrett Duff, Integrated Science, 3rd year, garrett.duff@carleton.ca</li>
  <br><p>My name is Garrett Duff and I'm running to be your next Science Society president.  Starting in September I'll be going into fourth year in integrated science with a concentration in life and health sciences.  Along with keeping up with a full course load, I stay active in the Carleton community by being a residence fellow, a director on the CSSS, program rep on CASG, campus tour guide, and CUSERT responder. 
There's many reasons that I want to be the next CSSS president, but the largest one is probably the urge to help the students voices be heard. I like to think of myself as knowing many students at Carleton, and hopefully if elected as president I can speak to each of you and make your voices heard and the changes you want seen.</p>

I’ve been apart of planning the amazing Science Winter Formal and have served on CASG as a representative. I will bring my experience in conflict resolution and information flow from cadets and working as a parliamentary intern to your society.

  <p>I am a third year transfer student in Neuroscience, Combined Honours with specific interest in psychiatric research. I am the VP Internal of the Student Alliance for Mental Health, volunteer at the Health and Wellness Centre and am a basketball coach in the Ottawa community. As a student at U of T before trasferring, I was a class representative for the Psychology Student Association and Frosh leader. My voice is one that attempts to give value to those who he represents and especially those who feel marginalized and ignored. I want to ensure that events CSSS present not only focus on the well-established scientific fields on campus, but the developing programs like Neuroscience. The research in these fields is equally as exciting and the opportunities to get involved need to be properly represented, especially in the field of mental health.


I wish best of luck to my fellow candidates, and always am excited to meet my fellow Neuro students, so feel free to say hi!</p>
