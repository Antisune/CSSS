####Michael Hildebrand
The inability to effectively treat and manage chronic pain is one of the major public health challenges facing Canada today. One in five Canadians experiences chronic pain, imposing huge personal and societal costs. The spinal cord is an essential component of the pain transmission pathway and is a major site of dysfunction in chronic pain syndromes. Professor Hildebrand will address how chronic pain is thought to be mediated at the molecular and cellular levels, including how taking a foot off the brake directly causes a stepping on the gas for spinal cord excitability, leading to chronic pain. He will then discuss some current and potential future pain therapeutics that work to stop this runaway train of chronic pain.
