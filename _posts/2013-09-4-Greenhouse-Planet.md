Arctic sea ice is melting at unprecedented rates leading to predictions of an Arctic Ocean that could be ice-free during the summer months in the not so distant future. During the geological past the worldâ€™s polar regions have experienced phases that were ice free and one of those was the Cretaceous Period marked by times of extreme greenhouse temperatures. During the presentation we will visit ancient settings of the Cretaceous polar sea as exposed in the Canadian High Arctic and terrestrial and marine settings of and around the Antarctic Peninsula. There, outcrops of Cretaceous sediments and their fossil content tell a story of rich ecosystems that were adapted to a much warmer earth.
