Biophotonics is a rapidly emerging field arising from the convergence of optics and the life sciences. Light interacts with living systems at a molecular level, and generates very high resolution images. This optical imaging technology promises to revolutionize the field of medicine due to its comparatively lower cost and high sensitivity combined with minimal toxicity. It offers tremendous potential for early detection, diagnostics and treatment of disease. This talk will focus on past developments, current work and future trends in optical imaging techniques in biomedicine.
