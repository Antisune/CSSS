blurb: I'm a second year honours biochemistry student that spends any extra time being outdoors or with CSSS and CASG. I've lived in North Vancouver, Yellowknife and Montreal before I came to Carleton. Anyone is welcome to reach out about anything. If you have an camping trip planned out let me know too and I'll join.
