blurb: I am a third year Honours Statistics student. I'm very involved in the Carleton community, being co-president of the Carleton Math Society, holding the School of Math and Statistics seats on both CASG and CSSS, I am the technical lead on the CUMC 2014 planning committee, and co-founder of Carleton Wings Tutoring. I'm very excited to hold this seat and represent the interests of Math students at Carleton. Contact me anytime if you have any questions, concerns or want to discuss anything at all.
