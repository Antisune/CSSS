blurb: I'm a 4th year CS student and I love diving head-first into problems to fix them! You can usually find me hacking away on the newest and weirdest projects the CCSS has decided to offer. Other than that I love live music, Sci-fi marathons, and karaoke shows (maybe too much). If you've got questions or problems with CS at Carleton then I'm your guy.
