blurb: My name is Nick and I’m a fourth year Neuroscience and Mental Health student. I’m honoured to have been given the privilege to represent my fellow peers at CSSS Council and the neuro department. I have been involved in a variety of our campus’ student support services over the years and I’m excited to be a councillor. Feel free to approach me if you ever have any questions or concerns about what’s happening with Neuro at Carleton. Cheers!
