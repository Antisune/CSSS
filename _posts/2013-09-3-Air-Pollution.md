####Paul Villeneuve
It has been more than 60 years since the Great Smog of 1952 in London, England, where the public became aware of how increased levels of outdoor air pollution can dramatically affect human health. Since then, a number of different types of epidemiological studies have investigated how short-term (i.e. day to day) changes in air pollution can influence acute health responses. More recently, the focus of many studies has been whether longer term exposure to air pollution plays a role in the development of disease. Many improvements have also been made in how we are able to measure air pollution. At this time, air pollution exposure is now linked to wide array of adverse health conditions, though for some, a cause-effect relationship is controversial. Canadian epidemiological studies have played an important role in the air pollution research area. Professor Villeneuve will review the contributions of many of these studies, and outline ongoing and future possibilities for research.
